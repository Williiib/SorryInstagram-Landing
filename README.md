## 🌍 Our Mission

To create a European-based social media platform that prioritizes data sovereignty, privacy protection, and respects European values and cultures. SorryInstagram aims to keep European data within EU borders, protected by GDPR standards, while offering a feature-rich experience for users to share moments that matter.

## 🔮 Our Vision

We envision a future where Europeans can connect, share, and interact online without compromising their digital rights or supporting the data exploitation economy. By keeping value, innovation, and data within the EU, we aim to strengthen Europe's digital economy while fostering a healthier social media environment.

## 💡 Why Europe Needs Its Own Platform

### Data Sovereignty and Privacy
- European users' data is currently stored and processed primarily in the US
- With SorryInstagram, data stays within EU borders, protected by GDPR
- Meta generates approximately €84 per European user annually through data monetization

### Economic Independence
- Most of Meta's revenue from European operations leaves the EU digital economy
- Building a European platform keeps this value within our economic zone
- Supports the development of Europe's own software industry and digital capabilities

### Digital Autonomy in a Divided World
- American platforms increasingly reflect US political polarization
- Europe has an opportunity to create platforms that reflect its own values
- Focus on community and shared values rather than engagement through controversy

## ✨ Key Features

- **Web3 Ready**: Future-proof with blockchain integration for digital ownership
